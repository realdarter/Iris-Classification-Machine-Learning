# Iris Dataset Classification with Machine Learning AlgorithmsðŸŒº
Classifying Iris dataset with Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN. Goal: understand, train accurate models, evaluate with 5-fold CV.

# Requirements
- Python 3.0 or better
- Packages: numpy scikit-learn xgboost (You can install in terminal using pip install numpy, pip install scikit-learn, pip install xgboost)

# Setup
- Open Terminal
- CD to Directory
- Download package using 'git clone https://github.com/realdarter/Iris-Classification-Machine-Learning'
- Using Python run the iris_dataset.py

It will then print
```
Iris Dataset:
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of iris, which has three classes: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
```
After the program has finished it will print accuracy, F1-score, ROC AUC for:
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors.
